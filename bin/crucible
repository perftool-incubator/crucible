#
# Crucible is meant to be run from a single command, 'crucible'
# and provide all the functionality from these subprojects.
#
# The system where 'crucible' is run is the 'crucible-controller'.
# It is not necessary to install crucible on any system-under-test
# (host, cluster, cloud, etc).  The crucible-controller is where
# a user initiates benchmark runs, to be executed on remote
# systems-under-test, including remote-hosts and k8s clusters (more
# to follow).  These systems-under-test are called endpoints, and a
# benchmark run can include multiple endpoints, even with different
# endpoint types (for example uperf clients on remote-hosts and uperf
# servers in mulitple k8s clusters).
#
# The crucible controller only requires two software packages:
# - podman
# - git
# 
# Crucible also requires that a container registry with
# push and pull capabilities, to be used for dynamic image
# building for benchmarks and tools.  The following must be
# set in /etc/sysconfig/crucible:
# CRUCIBLE_CLIENT_SERVER_REPO
# CRUCIBLE_CLIENT_SERVER_AUTH
#
# YOU MUST CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON A CONTAINER REGISTRY
# If you are working among a team, you can use the same account.
#
# Finally, crucible-controller will use publicly available
# container image to execute all subprojects.  This container is
# defined in /etc/sysconfig/crucible with:
# CRUCIBLE_CONTAINER_IMAGE
# All of code for subprojects are contained on the controller, under
# $CRUCIBLE_HOME/subprojects, but the crucbile-controller container image
# provides all software dependencies to run that code.
#
# AS A CRUCBILE USER, YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO INSTALL ANY SOFTWARE
# OTHER THAN PODMAN AND GIT.
