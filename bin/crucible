# Crucible's purpose is to provide a single interface
# for all of these subprojects for a seamless performance
# benchmark and tool harness solution

# Crucible expects to have these subprojects (eventually):
#
# Project-name      Commands        Purpose                   Status
#
# Rickshaw          run-benchmark   Coordinate a full "run"   Not implemented
#                   clear-result    of a benchmark with one
#                                   or more iterations
#
# Multiplex         gen-iterations  Convert a user's list     Minimally viable,
#                                   of benchamrk params       Integrated
#                                   (--opt val1,val2)
#                                   into multiple benchmark
#                                   iterations
#
# <remote-exec>     auth-hosts      Automated ssh key         Not implemented
#                   ssh-hosts       installation, multi-
#                                   remote-host execution
#
# Roadblock         <TBD>           Provide synchrnization    Minimally viable,
#                                   across endpoints (hosts   Not integrated
#                                   and/or containers) and
#                                   this controller
#
# Workshop          <TBD>           Image management for      Under Development
#                                   endpoint execution
#
# <tools-project>   register-tool   Integrate various tools   Not implemented
#                   unregister-tool for execution
#
# <elastic/CDM>     query-elastic   Data storage, query,      Under developoment
#                   import-elastic  reporting, etc.
#                   build-elastic
#
#
# Addtionally, Crucible will work with one or more
# benchmark or tool subprojects, found in:
# ./subprojects/tools
# ./subprojects/benchmarks
# 
# These subprojects provide configuration information,
# integration scripts, and post-processing scripts
# for a specific benchmark or tool, like Fio or Iostat.

# Crucible is meant to be run from a single command, 'crucible'
# and provide all the functionality from these projects.
